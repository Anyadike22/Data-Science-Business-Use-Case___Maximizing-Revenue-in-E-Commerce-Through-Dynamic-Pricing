# Data-Science-Business-Use-Case___Maximizing-Revenue-in-E-Commerce-Through-Dynamic-Pricing

## 1. Business Problem
An e-commerce company aims to increase revenue but faces challenges with static pricing strategies, which fail to adapt to market demand, competitor actions, and customer segment behavior. Traditional pricing may leave revenue opportunities untapped or alienate key customer segments, risking long-term loyalty.

## 2. Objective
Implement a dynamic pricing strategy that adjusts prices in real-time for distinct customer segments, balancing revenue optimization with customer satisfaction. The strategy should use machine learning models to analyze demand elasticity, competitor pricing, and customer behavior.

## 3. Customer Segmentation
Price-Sensitive Shoppers: Prioritize low prices, high purchase frequency for discounted items.

Loyal Customers: High lifetime value, less price-sensitive but expect consistency.

Premium Shoppers: Focus on quality/convenience, tolerate higher prices.

Deal-Seekers: Engage only during promotions.

# Experiment Design: Validating Price Changes Across Segments

1. Hypothesis
Dynamic pricing tailored to customer segments will increase overall revenue without reducing customer satisfaction (measured via NPS, repeat purchases, or surveys).

2. Experiment Setup
Segmentation: Use clustering (e.g., RFM analysis) to categorize users into segments based on historical behavior.

Test Groups: For each segment, split users into control (static pricing) and test (dynamic pricing).

Pricing Rules:

Price-Sensitive: Small discounts during low-demand periods.

Loyal: Moderate discounts with personalized offers.

Premium: No discounts; highlight exclusivity.

Deal-Seekers: Time-bound promotions.

3. Metrics
Primary:

Revenue per user (RPU)

Conversion rate

Average order value (AOV)

Secondary:

Customer Satisfaction (post-purchase survey, 1–5 scale)

Cart abandonment rate

Repeat purchase rate (30-day follow-up)

Complaint volume

4. Execution
Duration: 4–6 weeks (capture multiple purchase cycles).

Sample Size: Ensure statistical power (e.g., 10,000 users per segment).

Tools: A/B testing platforms (Optimizely, VWO), ML models for dynamic pricing, analytics dashboards.

5. Control for External Factors
Monitor competitor pricing (tools like Prisync).

Exclude holiday periods or major sales events.

Use randomization to minimize bias.

6. Ethical Considerations
Avoid discriminatory pricing (e.g., based on sensitive attributes).

Ensure transparency: Inform users about personalized pricing in terms of service.
